# facial-emotion-recognition

Facial emotion  Recognition is done using Convolution Neural Networks.

The FER2013 dataset ( facial expression recognition) consists of 48*48 pixel grayscale face images. The images are centered and occupy an equal amount of space. This dataset consist of facial emotions of following categories:

0:angry
1:disgust
2:feat
3:happy
4:sad
5:surprise
6:natural


->We will build a convolution neural network architecture and train the model on FER2013 dataset for Emotion recognition from images.

Download the dataset from the above link. Extract it in the data folder with separate train and test directories.
